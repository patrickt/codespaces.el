This package provides support for connecting to [[https://github.com/features/codespaces][GitHub Codespaces]] in Emacs via [[https://www.gnu.org/software/tramp/][TRAMP]]. It provides a handy =completing-read= UI that lets you choose from all your created codespaces. Here's a screenshot (running with [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][vertico]]):

[[./screenshot.png]]

Here is an example =use-package= declaration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package codespaces
  :config (codespaces-setup)
  :bind ("C-c S" . #'codespaces-connect))
#+end_src

You will need to have the GitHub [[https://cli.github.com][command line tools]] (=gh=) installed. If you use =use-package-ensure-system-package=, Emacs can install them for you automatically:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package use-package-ensure-system-package :ensure t)
(use-package codespaces
  :ensure-system-package gh
  :config (codespaces-setup))
#+end_src

* Other recommended configs

I /strongly/ recommend you customize ~vc-handled-backends~ and remove the ones that you don't use. I suffered considerable lag to Codespace instances before I did so.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq vc-handled-backends '(Git))
#+end_src

Use the host's PATH as TRAMP's [remote path](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/tramp/Remote-programs.html):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'tramp-remote-path 'tramp-own-remote-path)
#+end_src

Use SSH connection sharing to reduce the number of new SSH connections that TRAMP needs to spawn for refreshing buffers. In your `~/.ssh/config` file, add the lines:

#+begin_src
  	ControlMaster auto
	  ControlPath ~/.ssh/sockets/%r@%h-%p
	  ControlPersist 600
#+end_src

And to disable TRAMP's default ControlMaster settings in your Emacs config, add:

#+begin_src
(setq tramp-ssh-controlmaster-options "")
#+end_src

* User-facing commands
- =codespaces-connect= brings up a list of codespaces, and upon selection opens a Dired buffer in =/workspaces= (the default Codespaces location).
- =codespaces-start= brings up a list of inactive codespaces and upon selection spawns a task that starts the selected codespace.
- =codespaces-stop= does the same but for stopping active codespaces.

* Missing features
- Should ensure that =gh codespace list= works okay.
- Completion should sort codespaces by most-recently-used.
- Should have an unobtrusive =special-mode= buffer for outputs.
- Should have a nice ~transient.el~ UI.

Thanks to [[https://github.com/anticomputer][Bas Alberts]] for writing the code to register =ghcs= as a valid TRAMP connection method.
